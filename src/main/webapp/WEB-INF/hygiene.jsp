		<h3 > Baby bath time: how often? </h3>
		</div>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		A bath 2-3 times a week is enough to keep your baby clean. But if your baby really likes baths, you can bath baby once a day. Bathing more than this can dry out your baby's skin.
		
		You can keep your baby's genitals clean between baths by using warm water and cotton wool.
		
		About 5 - 10 minutes is long enough for a baby bath. This is especially important if your baby has dry or sensitive skin.
		 </p>
		 
		 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
		<h3 > When to give your baby a bath </h3>
		</div>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		 You can bath your baby at any time of the day. It's a good idea to pick a time when you're relaxed and you won't be interrupted. Try not to bath your baby when they're hungry or straight after feed.
		
		If bathing relaxes your baby, you can use it as a way to settle your baby in the evening. Some babies sleep longer after an evening bath.
		
		
		 </p>
		
		 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
		<h3 > Where to bath your baby </h3>
		</div>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		You can bath your baby in a baby bath until they're too big to fit comfortably. Then it might be easier to bath your baby in the big bath.
		
		You can help babies get used to the big bath by putting the small baby into the big bath a few times. Once your baby is ready for the big bath, you might like to take a bath with your baby (while keeping safe and having an extra person around to help). You can also shower with your baby. Keep your baby's face away from the pouring water and make sure the water isn't too hot.

		<p class="text-center ">
		Take the phone off the hook or turn your phone off while bathing your baby. You'll be less likely to get distracted.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Make sure you have everything you need nearby - for example , towel, washcloth, bath toys, lotion or shampoo, clean clothes and clean nappy. This way you can keep your eyes and hands on your baby at all times.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Make sure all bath lotions, shampoos and electrical appliances are out of baby's reach.
		</p>

		<p class="text-center ">
		Take off your watch and jewellery. Wash your hands.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Check the water temperture is 37-38°C before you put your baby in.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Dry and dress your baby on a towel on the floor if possible. Its safer than on a change table. If your using a change table, always keep one hand on your baby. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Place your baby in a safe area like a cot after they're dry and dressed.
		</p>
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Empty the bath as soon as you're finished with it. Remove bath plugs from the bath when they're not in use.

		<h1 class="text-center "> Baby bath time: step by step </h1>
		
		<h3 class="text-center my-5 "> Here are basic steps for giving your baby a bath: </h3>
		
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Put a non-slip bath mat on the bathroom floor and one in the bath.
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Fill the bath with just enough water to wash your baby. For babies who can sit up, fill the bath to the depth of their belly buttons.		
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Use warm (not hot) water, <u> about 37°C or 38°C </u> . Turn the water off. Test the temperature with a thermometer or your wrist or elbow before you put baby into the bath.
		</p>
		

		<p class="text-center ">
		Briefly run cold water through the tap.
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Gently lower your baby into the bath, keeping a hand on your baby at all times.
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		If bathing your baby in the big bath, kneel down or sit on a low stool so that you don't hurt your back.
		</p>
		
			
		<p class="text-center ">
		Shampoo your baby's hair last (you need to do this only once or twice a week). To do this, lie baby on their back and gently rinse their hair.		
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Use a soft washcloth to gently clean your baby's face, then their neck and body, leaving the genitals and bottom until last.
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Gently lift your baby out of the bath and wrap them in a soft dry towel to keep them warm.
		</p>

<br>

		<p class="text-center ">
		Try to keep soap, shampoos and bubble baths to a minimum - they can irritate skin & cause nappy rash. A mild non-soap cleanser is a good alternative. 
		</p>
