		<p class="my-3  mx-5"  style="font-weight: bolder;"> Home safety is about supervision in safe environments. Children also need to learn what is and isn't safe.</p>
		
		<p class="my-3 mx-5"  style="font-weight: bolder;">You can do a lot to avoid common home injuries like falls, burns and scalds, poisoning, drowning, strangulation and suffocation.</p>
		
		<p class="my-3 mx-5"  style="font-weight: bolder;">It's important to know basic first aid and CPR.</p>

		<h1 > Promoting child safety at home </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" > Your adult-friendly home has many potential hazards for a child. But you can keep your child safe by finding out what the risks are, and then preventing or removing them.</p>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >But even when you think you've removed all the home safety hazards, the reality is that children can still have tumbles and falls. That's why supervision is one of the keys to child safety at home.</p>
				
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" > Also, as your child grows and learns to climb and open things, you need to be alert for new hazards. You'll probably need to change the environment to make sure your home is still a safe and creative place to play and explore.</p>
				
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" > And along with supervision and a safe environment, you can also improve home safety by teaching your child about what's safe and what's not.</p>

		<div class="text-center my-5">
		
		<h1 > Baby furniture and equipment </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Safe baby furniture and baby equipment will help to protect your child. Always look for cots, mattresses, portacots and high chairs with the Australian Standards mark.</p>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >There are no Australian Standards for change tables and safety gates, so it's important to look carefully at the safety features of any tables and gates you're interested in.</p>

		<div class="text-center my-5">
		
		<h1 > Burns and scalds prevention </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >To prevent burns, keep your child away from fire and hot surfaces. Keep a close eye on your child whenever they're near things that can burn - especially around stoves, ovens, microwaves, heaters and other appliances.</p>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Hot food and drinks and too-hot baths are a major cause of scalds for babies and children. Here are some simple safety precautions to avoid these risks:</p>
				
<br>
				
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Keep hot food and drinks away from and out of reach of children.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Avoid holding your child if you're having hot food and drinks.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Always test bath water temperature before bathing children - the safest bath temperature is 37-38°C.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Have the hot water delivered to your bathroom at maximum of 50°C. You still need to mix cold water with the hot water coming out of your taps to get the right bath temperature for babies and children.</p>

		<h1 > Electrical safety </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Here are tips for electrical safety at home:</p>
						
<br>
				
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Get a licensed electrician to install safety switches, which cut power off quickly to avoid electrocution.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Get a licensed electrician to do any repairs.</p>

		<h1 > Falls prevention at home </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Falls are the most common cause of injuries and visits to hospital in every age group.</p>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >You can help to keep your child safe by watching the new skills they're learning, and the new places they can reach - and then adjusting your home. For example:</p>
				
<br>
				
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >When your child starts crawling, install safety guards across entries to stairs and balconies. And you still need to supervise your child on stairs and balconies.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >When your child starts climbing, lock windows - particularly upper-storey windows - restrict window openings, or shield them with firmly attached window guards. This will stop your child climbing out and falling.</p>
																
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Leave a hall light on at night, or use sensor lights to make it easier for older children to get to the toilet without tripping.</p>

		<h1 > Furniture safety </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Children can be seriously injured if furniture tips and falls on top of them. Here are ways to reduce the risk of this happening:</p>
						
<br>
				
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Check that furniture is sturdy - your child shouldn't be able to pull it down or knock it over. Anchoring furniture like bookshelves and wardrobes to the wall or floor reduces the risk of them tipping.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Brace or strap televisions to the wall or entertainment unit.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Move furniture with sharp corners away from areas where children run around, like hallways and near doorways. If you can't move the furniture, pad its corners with foam or corner protectors.</p>

		<h1 > Glass safety </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >When children are running around at home, it's easy for them to run into glass windows and doors. Here are tips to keep your child safe around glass:</p>
						
<br>
				
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Install safety glass in windows and doors or apply shatter-resistant film to windows and doors of older homes.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Put stickers on glass at eye level.</p>

								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Lock away hand tools like saws and drills, and keep lawnmowers, chainsaws and other sharp tools out of reach.</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Make sure your child is out of the way when you're using tools.</p>

				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Working smoke alarms are an essential fire safety precaution.</p>
				
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >By law your home must have at least one working smoke alarm installed on each level. For overall fire safety at home, you should install a smoke alarm outside the sleeping areas of your home. It's also a very good idea to install alarms in bedrooms where people sleep with their doors closed.</p>
				
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Test your smoke alarms every month and replace batteries each year. Replace the smoke alarms themselves every 10 years.</p>

								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >removing potential poisons</p>
								
								<p class="my-3  mx-5" >storing chemicals and medicines up high in a locked cupboard or cabinet</p>

		<h1 > Strangulation and suffocation prevention </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Many homes have everyday items that could strangle or suffocate a child. These items include soft toys and bedding, blinds, cords and ropes, and bags, boxes and packaging.</p>
						
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Here are some essential safety tips to keep your child safe from suffocation and strangulation:</p>

		<h1 > Water safety </h1>
		
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >Water safety depends on 100% active adult supervision whenever your child is around water. This includes around baths, pools, ponds, dams, rivers, creeks, baths and buckets with water.</p>
						
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >If you have a pool, by law you must have a pool fence and self-locking gate that meets Australian Standard AS:1926. Regularly check and maintain the pool fence and gate to make sure it's in proper working order. Never leave the gate propped open.</p>
						
				<p class="my-3  mx-5" >For bath safety, always supervise and give your full attention to babies and children under five years in the bath. Never leave children alone in the bath or bathroom. Never leave older children or siblings to supervise.</p>
