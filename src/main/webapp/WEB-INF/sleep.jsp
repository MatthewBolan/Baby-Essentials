		<h2 > Helping babies sleep and settle in the early months </h2>
		</div>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		In the first six months of life, babies need to wake at night to get enough food for growth and development. For most babies, sleeping "through the night" and settling by themselves come later, when they're developmentally ready.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		But there are three things you can do in the early months to help with baby sleep and settling:
		 </p>
		 
		 <div class="my-5">
		 <p class="text-center " style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Emphasis the difference between night and day.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		Put your baby to bed drowsy but awake.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Start a sleep routine.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 	<p class="text-center ">
		 	And if you do these things in the first six months, it can help your baby learn to sleep and settle independently later on, when baby is developmentally ready.

					<div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
		<h2 > Emphasising the difference between night and day </h2>
		</div>
		
		
		<p class="text-center ">
		Your newborn doesn't understand the difference between day and night. It's quite common for newborns to be wide awake during the night and then sleepy during the day.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 In these first six months, here are some things you ca do to help your baby get used to the idea that night is different from the day, ans that night is a good time to sleep:
		 </p>
		 
		  <div class="my-5">
		 <p class="text-center " style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 During the night, keep the room dark or dimly lit, and quiet.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		Use a dim light when you need to attend to your baby during the night. Try not to turn on a bright overhead light.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 At night, respond to your baby's cries quickly, and settle or feed baby as soon as you can.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Give night feeds in the bedroom. This will help to keep these feeds brief and make them different from daytime feeds.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 At night try to be soothing and quiet when you're with your baby. Try to keep play for daytime.
		 </p>
		 
		 </div>
		 
		 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
		<h2 > Putting babies to bed drowsy but awake </h2>
		</div>
		 
		 		<p class="text-center ">
		Try to put your baby to bed drowsy but awake. This gives your baby the chance to associate falling asleep with being in bed. If your baby has this sleep association, baby might be more likely to self-soothe when they wake in their bed in the night.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 Self-soothing is when your baby can calm down, relax and go to sleep again in their bed. Babies who can self-soothe sleep for longer periods and have longer total sleep times at night.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 If your baby associates falling asleep with rocking or feeding, baby might want rocking or feeding if they wake in the night. Of course, it's completely fine to rock or feed your baby to sleep in the night if this suits your baby and you.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 Here are some ways you can help your baby settle in bed, drowsy but awake:
		 </p>
		 
		<div class="my-5">
		 <p class="text-center " style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 During the night, keep the room dark or dimly lit, and quiet.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		Give your baby some time to settle. Avoid picking up your baby as soon as they grizzle. Many babies grizzle when you first put them into the cot, and giving them a minute or two to settle can help. But if your baby starts crying, they need comforting.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 As your baby gets older, give baby some time to settle if they grizzle when they wake during the night - baby might re-settle without your help. If you hear real crying, you need to help your baby re-settle.
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Try the patting settling technique. With this technique, you pat your baby until they calm down, but you stop patting just before sleep comes. A benefit of patting is that your baby is still going to sleep in the cot.
		 </p>
		 </div>	
		
		 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
		<h2 > Starting a sleep routine </h2>
		</div>
		 
		 		<p class="text-center ">
		When it feels right for your baby  and you, it can help to start doing things in a similar order each day - for example, feed, play, sleep. A baby sleep routine like this will help your baby settle into a regular sleep pattern.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 So when your baby wakes up during the day, a routine might be to:
		 </p> 
		 
		 <div class="my-5">
		 
		 <p class="text-center " style="font-weight: bolder;">
		Offer baby a feed
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		Change baby's nappy
		</p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Take time for talk, cuddles and play
		 </p>
		 
		  <p class="text-center" style="font-weight: bolder;">
		 Put baby back down for sleep when baby shows tired signs.
		 </p>
		 </div>	
		
		<div class="my-5">
		 <p class="text-center ">
		At night, you might choose not to play and instead focus on settling your baby straight back to sleep.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p class="text-center ">
		 With a newborn, its good to be flexible about feeding and sleep times - but it can still help to start doing things in a similar order.
